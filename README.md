I had a problem uploading this war concept project I made using Unity 3D to Github. 
There is a video version of this project in my drive link on my Github homepage. 
If you want to access the Unity file and see the game, contact me.

About the Game: The game I have made involves a spaceship taking off after hiding in the forest and being attacked by another spaceship after a while.
